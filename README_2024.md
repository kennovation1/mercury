Notes from bringing Mercury back to life after years being idle.

- Current state is that init after boot works usually
  - If it doesn't work, a reboot fixes
- Added an HDMI 7" display, this also serves as audio output

# TODO
- Mount display
- Set splash screen on display
- Connect cable to enable touch input on display
- Think about how to push debug to screen
- Need to mount a power strip
- Need to make knobs and pins more rigit
- Need to tighted all nuts
- Right O2 EMER LED is not working
- I needed to comment out guages in mercury_run.sh and in funbox.py
- Document button usage
- Would be nice to have a better light program with audio
- Should I try to fix gauges?
  - Use browser on 7" display?
