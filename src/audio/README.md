This is the unedited audio of the Mercury Atlas 6 / Friendship 7 Flight Audio Recorder as heard and spoken by Astronaut John Glenn during his entire 4 hour and 55 minute mission on February 20th 1962. It contains all audio that was recorded by the onboard flight recorder. However, you may notice it does not contain words like "God Speed John Glenn" since those words were not spoken over the "Air to Ground" loop and not heard by Glenn until after his mission.

# All raw air-to-ground audio (not ground loops)
- Each file is about 48 minutes except for last which is 18 minutes
